# React Native Expo Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive testing strategy for our React Native Expo application before publishing to the Google Play Store. It provides a structured approach to ensure our app meets quality standards and functions correctly across different devices and use cases.

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Unit Testing

Unit tests verify individual components and functions work correctly in isolation.

**Key Areas to Test:**
- Utility functions
- Hooks
- Redux/state management
- Service modules

**Tools:**
- Jest
- React Native Testing Library

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Create individual Jest configurations for different test types if needed
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on testing business logic and utility functions
- Aim for at least 70% code coverage

**Example Test Structure:**
```javascript
// Example utility function test
describe('isOnline utility', () => {
  it('should return true when online', async () => {
    // Mock implementation
    NetInfo.fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce({ isConnected: true });
    
    const result = await isOnline();
    expect(result).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should return false when offline', async () => {
    NetInfo.fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce({ isConnected: false });
    
    const result = await isOnline();
    expect(result).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### Phase 2: Component Testing

Component tests verify that UI components render correctly and handle user interactions properly.

**Key Components to Test:**
- Common UI components (buttons, cards, inputs)
- Screen components
- Navigation flows

**Testing Approaches:**
- **Snapshot Testing:** Capture component render output and verify it hasn't changed
- **Interaction Testing:** Test component behavior when clicked, swiped, etc.
- **Prop Testing:** Verify components respond correctly to different props

**Example Component Test:**
```javascript
describe('ArticleResultCard', () => {
  it('renders correctly with required props', () => {
    const tree = renderer.create(
      <ArticleResultCard
        title="Test Article"
        description="This is a test description"
        publishedDate="2023-01-01"
        source="Test Source"
        onPress={jest.fn()}
      />
    ).toJSON();
    
    expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
  
  it('calls onPress when pressed', () => {
    const mockOnPress = jest.fn();
    const { getByTestId } = render(
      <ArticleResultCard
        title="Test Article"
        description="This is a test description"
        publishedDate="2023-01-01"
        source="Test Source"
        onPress={mockOnPress}
        testID="article-card"
      />
    );
    
    fireEvent.press(getByTestId('article-card'));
    expect(mockOnPress).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.

**Key Areas to Test:**
- API integrations
- Data flow through multiple components
- Navigation between screens
- State management across the app

**Approaches:**
- Mock external services (API responses)
- Test complete user flows (e.g., login → navigate → perform action)
- Verify data persistence across screens

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing

E2E tests simulate real user behavior by testing the application as a whole.

**Tools:**
- Detox
- Maestro
- Appium

**Key Flows to Test:**
- Authentication (login/signup)
- Core functionality
- Navigation between main sections
- Critical user journeys

**Testing Strategy:**
- Run tests on actual devices or emulators
- Test both offline and online scenarios
- Verify performance under realistic conditions

### Phase 5: Manual QA Testing

Despite automation, manual testing remains important for subjective aspects.

**Areas to Focus:**
- UI/UX verification
- Edge cases
- Performance on low-end devices
- Accessibility testing
- User flow validation

**Checklist:**
- Test on multiple screen sizes and devices
- Verify app behavior when switching between apps
- Test with different network conditions
- Check handling of permissions and system interactions

## Google Play Store Testing

### Internal Testing

- Limited to up to 100 trusted testers
- Quick deployment for immediate feedback
- No review process required
- Ideal for early testing with team members

**Setup:**
1. Create an internal test track in Google Play Console
2. Build a release APK/AAB with `eas build`
3. Upload to internal test track
4. Add tester emails and share download link

### Closed Testing (Alpha)

- Expanded testing with controlled test groups
- Appropriate for more systematic testing
- Can include external testers with specific expertise

**Setup:**
1. Create a closed test track
2. Build and upload APK/AAB
3. Create and manage test groups
4. Collect feedback through Play Console

### Open Testing (Beta)

- Available publicly but labeled as "beta"
- Gathers feedback from a wider audience
- More representative of real-world usage

**Setup:**
1. Configure open testing track
2. Upload APK/AAB
3. Set gradual rollout percentage
4. Monitor feedback and crashes

### Pre-launch Reports

Google Play's automated testing on various devices to identify common issues:

- ANRs (Application Not Responding)
- Crashes
- UI/UX issues
- Performance problems
- Security vulnerabilities

**Best Practices:**
- Review all pre-launch reports before public release
- Address critical issues identified in reports
- Test fixes and re-upload for verification

## Performance Testing

Focus on key metrics:

- App startup time
- Screen transition time
- Memory usage
- Battery consumption
- Network efficiency

**Tools:**
- React Native Performance Monitor
- Flipper Performance Plugin
- Custom performance measuring

## Security Testing

- Auth flow security
- Data encryption
- API security
- Permissions handling
- Third-party library audits

## Accessibility Testing

- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast
- Touch target size
- Dynamic text sizing
- Alternative input methods

## Continuous Integration

Integrate testing into CI/CD pipeline:

- Run unit and component tests on every PR
- Run integration tests nightly
- E2E tests before releases
- Performance benchmarks to prevent regression

## Test Documentation

Maintain documentation for:

- Test coverage reports
- Known issues
- Test environments
- Test data

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensure our app's quality before release. By following these steps, we can identify and fix issues early, improve the user experience, and deliver a stable application to our users.
