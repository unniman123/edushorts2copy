# React Native Expo CursorRules (project-specific)

Use these guidelines in a React Native + Expo project:

- Prefer **functional components** with React Hooks (use `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).
- Use Expo SDK modules for device features (Camera, Notifications, Sensors, SecureStore, etc.).
- Set up navigation with **React Navigation** (StackNavigator, TabNavigator, etc.).
- Maintain a clear folder structure (`components/`, `screens/`, `navigation/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`).
- Use Expo’s asset system for images and fonts (add assets under `assets/` and load them via `Asset.loadAsync`).
- Style components with `StyleSheet` and design UIs using mobile-friendly patterns.
- Employ TypeScript for type safety (define interfaces/types for props and state).
- Follow naming conventions: components in PascalCase, variables/functions in camelCase.
- Prefer `const` for variables unless reassignment is needed (avoid unnecessary `let`).
- Include **error handling** (try/catch blocks, error boundaries) and logging for runtime issues.
- Support offline mode and use Expo’s OTA (over-the-air) updates for quick deployments.
- Optimize performance (use `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and lazy-load screens).
- Test components with **Jest** and React Testing Library (aim for high coverage, e.g. >80%).
- Document major components (prop types or interfaces, and usage notes) in the code or README.
