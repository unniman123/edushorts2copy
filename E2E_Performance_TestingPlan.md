# E2E and Performance Testing Plan

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests simulate real user behavior by testing the application as a whole, providing the highest confidence that the app works correctly from a user's perspective.

### Key Benefits
- Validates complete user workflows
- Tests the app in environments similar to production
- Identifies integration issues between components and services

### Tradeoffs
- More time-consuming to write and maintain than unit tests
- Slower to run compared to unit or integration tests
- More prone to flakiness (tests that fail randomly without code changes)

### Testing Tools

#### Detox
- Native testing framework specifically designed for React Native
- Provides stable testing environment with synchronization capabilities
- Direct interaction with app's UI elements
- Supports both iOS and Android platforms

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install Detox CLI
npm install -g detox-cli

# Add Detox to your project
npm install --save-dev detox

# Initialize Detox configuration
detox init
```

#### Maestro
- Newer mobile UI testing framework
- Simple YAML-based syntax for writing tests
- Good for creating quick E2E tests
- Can be integrated with EAS Builds

**Sample Maestro Flow:**
```yaml
appId: com.yourcompany.yourapp
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "Login"
- inputText: "test@example.com"
  inputType: "email"
- inputText: "password123"
  inputType: "password"
- tapOn: "Sign In"
- assertVisible: "Welcome"
```

   - Improve test performance
   - Document testing processes

## Performance Testing

Performance testing focuses on measuring how well the app performs under various conditions and ensuring it meets user expectations for speed and reliability.

### Key Metrics

1. **App Launch Time**
   - Cold start (app not running in background)
   - Warm start (app in background)
   - Target: Under 2 seconds for cold start, under 500ms for warm start

2. **Navigation Performance**
   - Screen transition time
   - Animation smoothness (frame rate)
   - Target: Under 300ms for transitions, consistent 60fps animations

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Baseline memory consumption
   - Memory growth over time
   - Memory leaks detection
   - Target: No continuous memory growth during extended use

4. **Network Efficiency**
   - API response handling time
   - Data transfer size optimization
   - Caching effectiveness
   - Target: Complete API transactions under 3 seconds, proper caching implementation

5. **Battery Impact**
   - Background power usage
   - Active usage power consumption
   - Target: Minimal background battery usage, optimal power usage during active use

6. **Bundle Size**
   - JavaScript bundle size
   - Asset optimization
   - Target: Main bundle under 5MB, optimized assets for fast loading

### Testing Approaches

#### Manual Performance Testing
- Conduct user experience testing on multiple devices
- Measure key interactions with stopwatch or recording
- Subjective evaluation of animations and transitions

#### Automated Performance Testing
- Use performance monitoring tools to capture metrics
- Set up automated test flows that measure performance
- Compare performance between builds to catch regressions

#### Remote Testing
- Use device farms to test on a range of hardware
- Gather performance metrics across device types
- Identify problematic device/OS combinations

### Testing Tools

1. **React Native Performance Monitor**
   - Monitor JavaScript thread performance
   - Track component render times
   - Identify performance bottlenecks

2. **Flipper Performance Plugin**
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Network request analysis

3. **Custom Performance Instrumentation**
   - Add performance markers in code
   - Track key user interactions
   - Log performance data for analysis

   ```javascript
   // Example of custom performance tracking
   const startTime = performance.now();
   // Operation to measure
   const endTime = performance.now();
   console.log(`Operation took ${endTime - startTime}ms`);
   ```

4. **Firebase Performance Monitoring**

### Best Practices

1. **React Native Specific Optimizations**
   - Use `React.memo()` for pure components
   - Implement `useCallback()` for functions passed to child components
   - Use `useMemo()` for expensive calculations
   - Avoid anonymous function creation in render methods

2. **List Optimization**
   - Use `FlatList` with proper `keyExtractor` and `getItemLayout`
   - Implement windowing for large lists
   - Use appropriate `initialNumToRender` and `maxToRenderPerBatch`

3. **Image Optimization**
   - Resize images to needed dimensions before display
   - Use proper image formats (WebP where supported)
   - Implement progressive loading for large images

4. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Use connection-aware fetching
   - Batch API requests where possible
   - Implement retry mechanisms for unstable connections

## Integration with Google Play Store Testing

E2E and performance tests should be run as part of the preparation for each Google Play Store release:

1. **Internal Testing**
   - Run full E2E test suite before uploading to internal track
   - Gather performance metrics from internal testers' devices
   - Address any critical issues before proceeding

2. **Closed Testing (Alpha)**
   - Monitor performance across expanded test group
   - Run E2E tests on representative devices from alpha testers
   - Collect detailed crash and ANR reports

3. **Open Testing (Beta)**
   - Use pre-launch reports to identify E2E issues
   - Monitor performance metrics at scale
   - Address performance issues affecting specific device groups

4. **Pre-launch Reports**
   - Review all automated test results from Google Play
   - Pay special attention to performance issues flagged
   - Address ANRs and crashes before full release
