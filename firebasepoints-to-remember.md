## Key Points to Note

1. __Backward Compatibility__:

   - Keeping Expo token as backup
   - Maintaining existing Supabase structure
   - No changes needed to admin panel

2. __Platform Specifics__:

   - iOS requires physical device testing (no simulator support for FCM)
   - Android works on both physical devices and emulators

3. __Firebase Console Benefits__:

   - No code changes needed for sending notifications
   - Rich message composition interface
   - Built-in delivery analytics
   - Scheduling capabilities
   - Topic messaging support

Would you like me to:

1. Explain any part of this plan in more detail?
2. Add specific test cases or scenarios?
3. Share my recommendations for transitioning from Expo notifications to FCM?
4. Switch to Act mode to begin implementation?

Remember: The beauty of this approach is that we maintain our Supabase infrastructure while leveraging Firebase Console's powerful notification features, with no changes needed to the admin panel!
