# Task for Cline: Complete News Migration Implementation

## Context & Progress

We're implementing a migration from a static news system to a Supabase-backed real-time news system. Here's what we've accomplished:

### Completed Components ✅

1. **Supabase Integration**
   - utils/supabase.ts: Real-time client setup
   - types/supabase.ts: Database and Article types

2. **News Context Layer**
   - context/NewsContext.tsx: State management and real-time subscriptions
   - Article data synchronization and updates

3. **UI Components**
   - components/ArticleResultCard.tsx: New article display component
   - components/CategorySelector.tsx: Category filtering
   - screens/HomeScreen.tsx & DiscoverScreen.tsx: Updated with real-time data

### Modified Files
1. App.tsx: Added NewsProvider
2. types/navigation.ts: Updated route params
3. screens/ArticleDetailScreen.tsx: Updated to use new Article type

## Remaining Tasks ⏳

Please complete the following tasks while maintaining the current UI/UX design:

### 1. Services Layer Implementation
Create `services/newsService.ts` with:
- Article analytics tracking
- Offline caching using AsyncStorage
- Error handling and recovery
- Rate limiting for API calls

### 2. Testing & Validation
Implement test cases in `__tests__` directory:
- Offline mode testing
- Real-time subscription validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory usage monitoring

### 3. Final Integration
Complete deployment preparation:
- Data migration utilities
- Feature parity verification
- Error logging setup
- Performance monitoring integration

## Important Notes

1. Do not modify existing UI/UX - maintain current design and user experience
2. Reference docs/newsarticlemigration.md for detailed implementation plan
3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing features
4. Prioritize performance and offline capabilities

## Getting Started

1. Begin with services/newsService.ts implementation
2. Follow the testing guidelines in Phase 3.3
3. Complete deployment tasks from Phase 4

Please maintain code quality standards and add comprehensive documentation for new features.
